# JavaScript Israel's Code Of Conduct

## Be kind, respectful and patient
We're all in this together to create a welcoming environment. Let's treat everyone with respect. Healthy debates are natural, but kindness is required.

## No Hate Speech, Swearing or Bullying
Make sure everyone feels safe. Bullying of any kind isn't allowed, and degrading comments about things like how much knowledge you have, race, religion, culture, sexual orientation, gender or identity will not be tolerated.
